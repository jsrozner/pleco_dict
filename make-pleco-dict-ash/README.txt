MakePlecoDict 0.1
Quick Instructions

To use MakePlecoDict, simply run it and follow the prompts to set up the file conversion.

MakePlecoDict accepts input files ONLY in little-endian, UTF-16 Unicode format; WordPad, EmEditor, and Microsoft Word are 3 good programs for editing this format. Files must be organized in the following way:

English-to-Chinese:
(word)<tab>(definition)

Chinese-to-English:
(word)<tab>(pinyin)<tab>(definition)

You may omit any of these fields, but you must keep the tabs intact.
Pinyin tones must be indicated with numbers, e.g. ni3hao3.
You may enter alternate traditional-charaters versions of headwords using brackets and dashes (just like they're displayed in PlecoDict).

For an example of a correctly-formatted MakePlecoDict input file, see the enclosed "sample.txt". Content in that file originally from CEDICT, copyright © 1997, 1998 Paul Andrew Denisowski, see http://www.mandarintools.com/cedict.html for more info.
